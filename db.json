The geometry of objects in two- or three-dimensional spaces is studied: near a point on them (locally) using differentiation and on the whole (globally) using integration. It includes polar coordinates, convergence of sequences and series, Maclaurin and Taylor series, partial derivatives, vector calculus leading to theorems of Green, Stokes and Gauss."
